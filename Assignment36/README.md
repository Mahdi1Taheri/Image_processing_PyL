Working with HSV color model
## Watermelo to Materwelon convertor in HSV color model
converting red color to green and green to red.<br>
This exercise was previously done in [Assignment 34](https://github.com/Mahdi1Taheri/Image_processing_PyL/blob/main/Assignment34/Materwelon.ipynb)
with the rgb color model.<br>
But with hsv color model, it is more understandable and gives better output.<br>
